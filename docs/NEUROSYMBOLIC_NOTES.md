# Neuro-Symbolic Notes — CORTEX-12

CORTEX-12 sits between neural representation learning and symbolic reasoning.

---

## Neural Components

- Continuous latent vectors
- Contrastive alignment
- Learned perceptual geometry

---

## Symbolic Components

- Explicit concept names
- Structured attribute memory
- Deterministic rendering

---

## What Is Symbolic Here?

- Memory is external and editable
- Concepts are named and inspectable
- Composition is explicit

---

## What Is Not Symbolic

- No logic engine
- No rule solver
- No theorem proving

---

## Design Position

CORTEX-12 emphasizes grounded abstraction without embedding logic directly
inside the neural model.
