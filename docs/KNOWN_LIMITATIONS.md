# Known Limitations — CORTEX-12

CORTEX-12 is intentionally constrained.

---

## Current Limitations

- No temporal reasoning
- Limited texture sensitivity
- Single-object bias
- No end-to-end task optimization
- CPU-only training speed

---

## Design Intent

These limitations are deliberate tradeoffs made to prioritize:

- Stability
- Interpretability
- Inspectability
- Long unattended runs

Future extensions may relax some constraints.
