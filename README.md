## Overview

CORTEX-12 is designed as a **representation substrate** rather than an
end-to-end agent:

- Learns **128-dim visual embeddings** from pixels  
- Supports **interpretable semantic axes** (color, shape, size)  
- Uses **explicit external memory** rather than implicit weights  
- Safe for long unattended CPU training

Unlike large models, CORTEX-12 is **simple, inspectable, and deterministic**.

---

## Core Capabilities

- RGB images → compact vector embeddings  
- Explicit semantic attributes (color/shape/size)  
- Stable similarity comparisons across checkpoints  
- Compositional imagination via structured rendering  
- CPU-only execution (AMD-friendly)

---

## Why CORTEX-12

**Not a large language model, generative model, or foundation model.**  
Rather, CORTEX-12 focuses on:
- **Grounded perception** with explicit memory
- **Interpretable geometry** instead of opaque weight embeddings
- **Representation stability** over competitive accuracy

This makes it suitable as **a visual cortex module** rather than a
standalone task solver.

# 🧠 CORTEX-12 Semantic Axis Certification: A Novel Approach to Verifiable Perception

This document explains why **semantic axis certification** in CORTEX-12 is **unique and novel** compared to existing AI systems—including JEPAs, LLMs, and mainstream machine learning models.

---

## 🔍 Core Idea

CORTEX-12 enables **verifiable perception** by:
- Assigning fixed subspaces of its 128-d embedding to human-interpretable attributes (e.g., color, shape, size)
- **Certifying** these mappings using synthetic validation data
- Saving lightweight, human-readable **JSON certificates**
- Allowing runtime **probing** and **validation** without retraining

This turns perception into a **calibrated, auditable instrument**—not a black box.

---

## ❌ What Other Systems *Don’t* Do

### 1. **JEPAs (Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures)**
- **Examples**: I-JEPA, video JEPAs (Meta AI)
- **Limitations**:
  - Learn **implicit, high-dimensional embeddings** with no semantic guarantees
  - No mechanism to say “dimension 5 = redness”
  - Require GPUs and large-scale training
  - **Not designed for inspection or verification**
- ✅ **CORTEX-12**: Uses JEPA *principles* but enforces **explicit, certified semantic axes**

> 🚫 **No JEPA offers verifiable, interpretable axes out of the box.**

---

### 2. **Large Language Models (LLMs) & Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**
- **Examples**: CLIP, GPT-4V, LLaVA, Flamingo
- **Limitations**:
  - Representations are **emergent and distributed**
  - Interpretability relies on **post-hoc probing** (e.g., linear classifiers)—not guaranteed
  - Cannot produce **formal statements** like “this is red because subspace X matches centroid Y”
  - Not deterministic or CPU-friendly for long-term use
- ✅ **CORTEX-12**: Embedding space is **designed for human inspection**

> 🚫 **LLMs/VLMs are inherently opaque at the representation level.**

---

### 3. **Interpretable / Disentangled ML Models**
- **Examples**: β-VAE, FactorVAE, Concept Bottleneck Models
- **Limitations**:
  - **β-VAE**: Statistically disentangled—but latent meanings are **unknown without probing**
  - **Concept Bottleneck Models**: Require **human labels during training**—not post-hoc certifiable
  - None produce **human-readable certificates** (e.g., JSON files)
  - Most assume GPU training and lack **explicit memory**
- ✅ **CORTEX-12**: Certification is **post-hoc, reproducible, and decoupled from training**

> ⚠️ **Closest relatives—but still lack verifiability and CPU focus.**

---

### 4. **Neuro-Symbolic & Cognitive Architectures**
- **Examples**: Neural Turing Machines, ACT-R hybrids
- **Limitations**:
  - Often use **symbols as input**, not grounded visual perception
  - Rarely map **pixel inputs → certified symbolic predicates**
  - Tend to be complex research prototypes
- ✅ **CORTEX-12**: Perception **directly outputs logic-ready facts** via certified axes

> 🚫 **No system bridges pixels to symbols with geometric semantics.**

---

### 5. **Edge AI / TinyML Models**
- **Examples**: TensorFlow Lite, MobileNet
- **Limitations**:
  - Optimized for **speed/size**, not **trust or auditability**
  - Outputs are **class logits or opaque features**
- ✅ **CORTEX-12**: Designed for **trust on the edge**, not just efficiency

> 🚫 **Edge AI prioritizes inference speed, not explainability.**

---

## ✅ What Makes CORTEX-12 Unique?

| Feature | CORTEX-12 | Others |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Semantic axes certified via validation** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Human-readable JSON certificates** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Works without retraining** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **CPU-only, deterministic, safe for unattended use** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Embedding subspaces = symbolic predicates** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Explicit memory + JEPA principles** | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Modern AI has prioritized **scale and performance** over **trust and transparency**. CORTEX-12 offers a counter-paradigm:

> **“What if we built AI that is small enough to understand, structured enough to verify, and honest enough to explain?”**

This is critical for:
- **Safety-critical robotics**
- **Assistive technology**
- **Scientific instrumentation**
- **Education and AI literacy**

---

## 📌 Conclusion

> **No existing AI system—whether JEPA, LLM, or ML model—combines semantic axis certification, CPU-only operation, explicit memory, and post-hoc verifiability like CORTEX-12.**

It fills a vital gap: **verifiable perception for trustworthy, grounded AI**.

CORTEX-12 proves that **you don’t need scale to build systems that are simple, inspectable, and accountable**.

## 🚧 Training Progress (Phase 2)

**Status:** In progress  
**Dataset:** Tiny-ImageNet-200  
**Backbone:** DINOv2 ViT-S/14 (loaded via `torch.hub`)  
**Device:** CPU  
**Checkpoint Type:** Cortex head + concept memory (partial; backbone external)

---

### 📍 Mid-Phase-2 Milestone (~Step 5,600 / 12,000)

A mid-run checkpoint (`cortex_step05600.pt`) was evaluated to validate representation stability, concept separation, and overall system health.

---

### ✅ Load & Structural Integrity

- Checkpoint loads successfully in eval mode
- Cortex weights load as a **partial state_dict** (expected by design)
- Concept memory loads correctly
- Forward pass produces valid tensor shapes
- No NaNs or shape mismatches observed

**Smoke Test Output:**

feat: [1, 128]
pc:   [1, 19]
ps:   [1, 25]
pz:   [1, 4]
sides:[1, 1]
OK

---

### ✅ Representation Stability (Automated)

`test_v12_compare_stability.py` was run against the checkpoint.

**Results:**

SAME  mean = 0.9887   std = 0.0027
DIFF  mean = 0.5720   std = 0.0100
OK Compare stability verified

## Phase-2 Real-Image Ablation (TinyImageNet)

We evaluate the effect of incorporating real images during Phase-2 training using a controlled ablation against a no-real-image baseline. At equivalent early checkpoints (1k steps), both models exhibit nearly identical symbolic stability (**SAME ≈ 0.988**, **DIFF ≈ 0.572**), demonstrating that the introduction of real images does not distort or collapse the learned concept manifold. Crucially, extending real-image training to later checkpoints (10k steps) preserves this stability (**SAME = 0.9878 ± 0.0024**, **DIFF = 0.5736 ± 0.0109**), indicating no late-stage degradation.

Qualitative semantic probes further show consistent ordering across identity, color, size, and shape variations (e.g., *ruby–ruby* ≈ 0.978, *ruby–size* ≈ 0.865, *ruby–color* ≈ 0.787, *ruby–shape* ≈ 0.754), closely matching earlier checkpoints and the no-real-image baseline. Together, these results demonstrate that Phase-2 real-image exposure improves perceptual grounding and invariance **without overwriting symbolic structure**, validating the JEPA-style separation between representation stabilization and semantic geometry.


**Interpretation:**
- Extremely high self-similarity with very low variance → **stable embeddings**
- Clear separation between different concepts
- No evidence of representation collapse or drift

---

### 🧠 Manual Concept Geometry Probes

Manual evaluations were performed using the interactive eval interface.

| Comparison | Similarity (↑ = closer) | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| ruby ↔ ruby | ~0.974 | High self-consistency |
| ruby ↔ ruby_big | ~0.865 | Size encoded as a separable attribute |
| ruby ↔ emerald | ~0.78 | Color separation present but weaker |
| ruby ↔ green_diamond | ~0.78 | Confirms color is a lower-weight axis |
| ruby ↔ red_square | ~0.75 | Shape difference dominates separation |

**Key Insight:**  
At this stage, the model prioritizes **object structure / shape**, followed by **size**, with **color encoded but less dominant**. This behavior is consistent with expected JEPA-style training dynamics, where structural identity stabilizes before fine-grained attribute disentanglement.

---

### 🎨 Scene Composition Check

The imagination / composition pathway was verified:

[SCENE] GENERATED: objects=2 complexity=1.17

Repeated runs produced consistent outputs, confirming deterministic behavior and a functioning composition pipeline.

---

### 📦 Checkpoint Characteristics

- File size: ~680 KB
- Contains:
  - Cortex projection / adapter weights
  - Concept memory state
- Does **not** include backbone weights (loaded from `torch.hub`)

This design allows fast copying, versioning, and evaluation without duplicating large backbone files.

---

### 📈 Summary (Step ~5600)

At this mid-Phase-2 checkpoint, the model demonstrates:

- ✅ Stable representations
- ✅ Clear concept separation
- ✅ Sensible attribute geometry (shape > size > color)
- ✅ Fully operational eval and tooling stack

This checkpoint serves as a **baseline reference** for later Phase-2 checkpoints (e.g. ~8k, ~10k, ~12k), where further attribute disentanglement—particularly color—is expected.

---

### Tiny-ImageNet doesn’t rewrite the concept manifold — it makes real-image embeddings invariant.

“On a real-image invariance benchmark (two augmented views of the same Tiny-ImageNet image), the with-real model achieves 0.835 ± 0.127 cosine similarity vs 0.686 ± 0.215 for the no-real ablation at 1k steps, demonstrating substantially improved real-world invariance without degrading symbolic stability.”

### Real-image invariance (same step count: 1,000)

### No-real (λ_real=0)

- mean = 0.6855
- std = 0.2152

### With-real (Tiny-ImageNet NT-Xent)

- mean = 0.8353
- std = 0.1266
