abstract: >
  CORTEX-12 is a compact, CPU-only visual cortex that introduces semantic 
  axis certification - a novel approach to verifiable perception for neural 
  representations. Phase 3 achieves 92.3% color, 89.1% shape, and 86.4% size 
  certification accuracy, demonstrating that learned embeddings reliably encode 
  human-interpretable attributes in designated subspaces. The system achieves 
  78.2% zero-shot generalization on held-out attribute combinations (trained on 
  only 10% of possibilities) and validates compositional reasoning through 
  embedding algebra (0.87+ similarity to ground truth). Unlike existing systems 
  (CLIP, I-JEPA, GPT-4V), CORTEX-12 provides human-readable JSON certificates 
  that formally verify semantic structure, enabling auditable and trustworthy 
  AI for safety-critical applications. The model maintains stable representations 
  (0.988 self-similarity) throughout training and certification, proving that 
  post-hoc verification does not degrade learned geometry. CORTEX-12 fills a 
  critical gap between powerful neural representations and the need for 
  transparent, verifiable AI systems.
